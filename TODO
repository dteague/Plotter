better rebinning/make optional
more robust normalizing (ie know when to ignore or do, ie different config)
clean up to make more readable
options and style working together
legend placed so doesn't cover up
get sigboth working (if need it)
automatic no bottom if sig graph but not signal
put cms prelimary on graph
Luminosity on top

Maybe add parsing tool?
